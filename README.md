# Spaz Desktop
## for Appcelerator Titanium Desktop

Spaz is an open source microblogging client written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This version runs on top of the Appcelerator Titanium Desktop web runtime platform.

Right now this is almost unusable: prefs and accounts don't save, window is basically unresizable, etc. Work needs to be done to convert AIR-specific code to Titanium equivalents.
